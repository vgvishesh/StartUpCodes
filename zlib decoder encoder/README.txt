->test.cpp is the file containg all the application code.
->(zlib decoder encoder.exe) is the executable file that can e run using the windows/unix command line.

->steps to build project on windows visual c++ express/ visual studios
	1. create a new win32 console project and select empty project.
	2. add test.cpp in the source of the project.
	3. open the folder containing test.cpp and add following files in that folder-
		- zconf.h
		- zlib.h
		- zlib1.dll 
		- zdll.lib
	4. now in visual studios open the project properties by right clicking on the
		project name solution explorer, and select properties.
	5. go to linker->inuput->additional dependencies , add zdll.lib in the field and 
		end it with a semicolon(;).
	6. compile the project and run it.

-> steps to use the .exe generated by compiling or using the .exe given here-
	1. using the windows command line , change the directory to location where .exe 
		is present.
	2. It uses stdin and stout streams for input and output respectively.
		Default stdin = keyboard , Default stdout = windows console.
		If you are using the defalut stdin and stdout, 
			1. Give input using keyboard on the console.
			2. To see utput terminate the input stream by pressing  Crtl + C.
	3. If you want to use a file to change default input stream and output stream-
		To Deflate (encode) 
			1. To give input using a file, e.g-
				-zlib decoder encoder.exe < hello.txt  // text file as input
				-zlib decoder encoder.exe < 1.jpg		// jpeg file as input
			2. To get output in a file, e.g-
				-zlib decoder encoder.exe < hello.txt > out.txt
				this takes input from a text file and writes the encoded output in the
				text file out.txt.
		To inflate (decode), give -d argument when executing the command.
			1. To give input using a file, e.g-
				-zlib decoder encoder.exe -d < hello.txt  // text file as input
				-zlib decoder encoder.exe -d < 1.jpg		// jpeg file as input
			2. To get output in a file, e.g-
				-zlib decoder encoder.exe < out.txt > new.txt
				this takes input from a text file and writes the decoded output in the
				text file out.txt.
